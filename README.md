Developed as an application for my Thesis, this SaaS web application was created using PHP and MySQL.

The developed application fulfilled its purpose towards the thesis by analyzing the different security vulnerabilities and their solutions for a SaaS based web application.

The application allows users to create an account, upload files such as text or images, and then be able to download or delete those uploaded files. The application acts as SaaS cloud storage for its users, allowing them to upload their personal files that only they will have access to. The user uploaded files are downloaded and stored on one of my personal hard drives, where the data is encrypted before being moved to storage.

As the name of the app suggests, it is a secure uploader, meaning secure coding techniques and procedures were utilized to combat any form of threats or vulnerabilities. I developed the application following the Secure Software Development Lifecycle methodologies and secure coding principles such as minimizing attack surface areas and validating input.

I used PHP almost extensively throughout this project to serve as app logic and security, and HTML for structuring the GUI. Apache and MySQL were used in conjunction to provide database functions to store user account names, hashed passwords, and uploaded file information. 

For details in the security procedures I utilized, see Chapter 5 in the full Thesis documentation.
